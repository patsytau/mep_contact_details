# MEP Contact Details

This script produces per-country lists of MEPs and their email addresses (along with their EU and national groups).

The details are saved in .csv files that (despite the extension) use a '#' character to separate fields (since some of the groups have commas in their names). 

The list of all MEPs available from https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/full-list/all does not include email addresses.
To get these, I used the XML files provided in the FOI request here: https://www.asktheeu.org/en/request/list_of_meps_and_their_offices_e_4

The lists can be generated by running the script without any parameters.
Alternatively, they will be attached to releases in this repository.
